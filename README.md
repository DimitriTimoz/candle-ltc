# Liquid Time Constant Neural Network
This repository is a rust implementation of the Liquid Time Constant Neural Network (LTCNN) as described in the paper "Liquid Time-Constant Networks" by Ramin Hasani, Mathias Lechner, Alexander Amini, Daniela Rus, Radu Grosu. The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04439).

This implementation is a work in progress and is not yet complete. The goal is to implement the LTCNN in rust with the [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) framework.
